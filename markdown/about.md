

_Soviet_ is built from the [Linux from Scratch](https://linuxfromscratch.org) project. It features a custom installer to keep your programs up to date, and the capability to submit programs to our repository.

**Soviet Linux is in the early stages of development.** There is active work being done to make _Soviet_ into a fully functional Linux experience. However, at this time it's not suitable for daily use.
We welcome contributions from interested workers. [Contact us](#contribute) to see how you can join us.
